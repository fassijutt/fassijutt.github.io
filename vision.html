 <b> VISION </b> 
<h3> <div> Parents choose online schooling for their young children for many reasons. 
"I think it's becoming more popular because of the convenience,"
 says a mom. "We can be on our own schedule." Many parents choose
 it because they're not satisfied with their local public school; 
 others find they have more control over what and how their children learn.

"We had all kinds of kids [enrolled in online school]. We had home bound kids 
who couldn't go to school because of a medical issue. We had actors, Olympic athletes,
 and other people who were not living in one place for a long time,as a student of our online institution. Our vision is to make online schools best in the world </div> </h3>
